Advent of Code
--------------
I have a need to learn [Go](https://golang.org). I learn best by _doing_ instead of being directed, pair programming, etc. 

I am using [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com) to help me learn the language through exploration.

This is an exercise for me to get my hands dirty, not for your review or criticism, constructive or otherwise.

I will likely be perpetually behind, as recreational time is currently scarce. Any effort I can put forth here will hopefully be well-spent as I venture onto other Go projects I will need to produce for my research.
